Project board columns:

1. **Customer App** – Screens like Home, Login, Order, Profile
2. **Vendor App** – Screens for viewing & managing orders
3. **Backend & Integration** – Supabase setup, auth, DB schema, APIs

Move your task cards across:

## 📅 Sprint Plan (4 Weeks)

| Week | Focus                                     |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Project setup, Menus,login/signup with Supabase |
| 2    | Cart, Order Flow                   |
| 3    | Vendor UI & integration              |

## ✍️ Commit Message Format

Use this convention for every commit:

```bash
TYPE: Short Summary
```

**Examples:**

* `CA: Build login screen UI`
* `VA: build vendor homepage`
* `BE: Connect Supabase auth`
where:
CA = Customer App
VA = Vendor App
BE = Backend End
---

## 🧳️ Best Practices

* Never push directly to `main`
* Always work on `feature/*` branches
* Keep PRs focused and small
* Pull latest `dev` before starting new work
* Always test your screen or logic before pushing

Let’s work as a team and ship something great together. 🚀
